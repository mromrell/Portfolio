I built this web application so that I (and anyone else who wants to join) can share the cool places they are are finding. This site is built with AngularJS and javascript on the frontend and powered by Django and Python on the server-side. I like Django because it's pretty straightforward and well documented. It's worth noting that I built everything on this site from scratch including the Login, Create and edit a location, the Ajax Filters and the javascript logic that powers all the dynamic content you see on the site. And yes, just about everything on the site is dynamic and responsive."

In other words, this app will allow you to create an account, then create a new proposal, and dynamically fill it with custom questions. They can assign each question (and that question's options) a value (ex: $300 for option 'A'). This let's a sales team walk through the newly created survey with a client and give them an immediate price quote. "

The site also has a fully functioning e-commerce store that I have recently turned off as a result of issues with my supplier. But I hope to bring it back online soon!"
